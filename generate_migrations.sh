# This script automates the process of generating Alembic database migrations.
# Use this to create a new migration file with the provided revision ID and title.
# The script should be run from the root directory of the project, preferably in the devcontainer.
# The convention for the revision ID is to use 3 digit numbers. For example: 001, 002, 003, etc.
# The revision title should be a short descriptive name for the migration without spaces.
#
# It performs the following steps:
# 1. Validates command line arguments (rev-id and revision title)
# 2. Starts required Docker services (database and backend)
# 3. Waits for the database to be ready
# 4. Generates an Alembic migration file with the provided parameters
#
# Usage:
#   ./generate_migrations.sh <rev-id> <rev-title>
#
# Arguments:
#   rev-id:     Unique identifier for the migration revision
#   rev-title:  Descriptive title for the migration
#
# Example:
#   ./generate_migrations.sh 1234abcd "add_user_table"


# Ensure the script exits on any error
set -e

# Check if the correct number of arguments is provided
if [ "$#" -ne 2 ]; then
